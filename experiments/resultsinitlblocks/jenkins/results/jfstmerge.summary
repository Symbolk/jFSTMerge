S3M was invoked in 2 JAVA files so far.
In these files, you avoided at least 1 false positive(s), and S3M did not find any occurrence of unstructured merge false negatives.
Conversely, you had no extra false positives, nor potential extra false negatives.

S3M reported 0 conflicts, totaling 0 conflicting LOC, compared to 1 conflicts and 3 conflicting LOC from unstructured merge.

Altogether, these numbers represent a reduction of 100.00% in the number of conflicts by S3M.
A reduction of 100.00% in the number of false positives.
And no difference in terms of false negatives.

Finally, S3M took 9.67 seconds, and unstructured merge 0.26 seconds to merge all these files.
